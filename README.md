# rxjs-vs-observer-pattern

## About
This repository features a comparison between implementing the same application in both RxJS and standard JavaScript using the Observer Pattern.
The Observer Pattern is famous for solving scenarios where some logic needs to listen(observe) for changes in the application, such as user input.

## Application
The application fetches users from GitHub when pressing a button.
The RxJS implementation is almost the exact implementation featured in Andr√© Staltz's tutorial on RxJS, The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing(https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754).
